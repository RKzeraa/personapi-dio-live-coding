In live coding I developed a small system for managing people in a company using a REST API, created with Spring Boot.

<h2>ðŸ›‘ Development Kit </h2>
<p>
âœ… Java Syntax<br>
âœ… Java JDK 11+<br>
âœ… IDE for Java development (I used IntelliJ)<br>
âœ… Git<br>
âœ… Rest<br>
âœ… GitHub<br>
âœ… Azure<br>
âœ… Spring Boot Framework<br>
âœ… Spring Data<br>
âœ… Sprint Test<br>
âœ… MapStruct<br>
âœ… Postman<br>
âœ… Maven 3.6.3+<br>
</p>

During the live, the following topics were addressed and developed:

* Project Initial Setup with Spring Boot Initialzr
* Creating a data model for mapping entities into databases
* Development of user management operations (Registration, reading, updating and removing people from a system).
* Relation of each of the operations mentioned above, with the REST architectural pattern, and each of the REST concepts applied during the development of the project was addressed.
* Development of unit tests for functionality validation
* System deployment in the cloud through Azure

To run the project in the terminal, enter the following command:

```shell script
mvn spring-boot:run 
```

After running the above command, just open the following address and view the project execution:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/people
```

To access the h2 database, just open the following address and manage the database:

```
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
```


The following prerequisites were necessary for the execution of the project developed during the live:

* Java 11 or higher versions.
* Maven 3.6.3 or higher versions.
* Intellj IDEA Community Edition or your favorite IDE.
* GIT version control installed on your machine.
* Account on GitHub to store your project in the cloud.
* Account in Azure for deploying the project in the cloud
* A lot of desire to learn and share knowledge
